IDLBridge
=========

A python wrapper for the IDL.

After exploring the various options available on the internet (pyidl, pyidlrpc, pidly) we have found that none of them have the feature sets we need to provide an effective migration tool from idl to python. These packages are either unmaintained (don't support python 3), are slow or use access routines that are impractical for multiuser systems (IDLRPC).

This is a simple idl bridge library that interacts via the idl "callable" library interface. The high level code is derived from pyidlrpc, though all the IDLRPC code has been replaced by direct calls to the IDL library interface.

The high level python interface is designed to hide the IDL calls behind python objects such that the IDL calls can be transparently replaced at a later date without requiring significant code refactoring.
